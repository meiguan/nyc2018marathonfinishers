# Analysis of 2018 NYC Marathon Finishers

Mei Guan, meiguan, yg833

## Problem Description:
The first New York City Marathon was organized in 1970 with only 127 entrants in Central Park where 55 men finished and the only female entrant dropped out due to illness, according to the NYRR site (here). This year (2018) marks the 48th year of the race and it has grown to include more than 52K finishers who ran the race with an average time of 4:40:22. And many of these 2018 NYC finishers would hopefully qualify for entry into the 2020 Boston Marathon which is much sought after. 

With this context, I am interested in learning more about the NYC Marathon Finishers-- who they are, where they come from, and their overall race performance. From this analysis of Marathon Finishers, I want to answer the question of what is the rate of Men vs. Women NYC marathon finishers who can meet the qualification standards for the Boston Marathon in 2020? Is there a difference in the qualifying rates between the genders especially considering the differing gender and age group time qualifiers as published by the Boston Athletics Association (https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/enter/qualify)? 

Note: The difference seems to be more generous to women and the older age groups. 

## Data: 
For this analysis, I will be doing some web-scraping to collect data on the 2018 marathon finishers from the New York Road Runners site: https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2018/finishers Through this link, we can find out information such as name, age, gender, country of origin, splits, and overall finish time. 

After obtaining this data, I will perform some basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset. I may also have to create some added features such as positive and negative splits to see how runners performed between segments of the race. I will also have to compare the finishing times to the published Boston Marathon qualifying times per gender and age group. 

## Analysis: 
For the analysis portion, I will likely have to do some statistical tests like Chi-Square on the rates/ proportions. I would like to do some modeling to predict if men or women are more likely to qualify for the Boston Marathon in 2020.

## Deliverable: 
At the end of this project, I hope to arrive at some statistical conclusions about my analysis that helps me answer the initial questions about the runners who ran the 2018 NYC Marathon and who may qualify for the Boston Marathon in 2020.
